# HEAD PREFECT’S MESSAGE
 
On behalf of the prefects’ body of **Sir Apollo Kaggwa Primary School – Mengo** and on my own behalf, I would like to bring you warm greetings.  Our school is one of a kind where one is handled well in order to achieve all that is required to be a whole child.

All academic spheres are catered for.  I would like to thank every body who elected me into office and saw it worth to serve this year.  I will not disappoint you.

The games’ department this term has done a lot to uplift the sports talents in us, and I belie the sportsmen and women among us will go far and wide.

The prefectorial office is still with many challenges to overcome but with the help of our teachers, I am certain that we shall over come.  I am glad that these challenges are training me to be a leader with tolerance.  The challenges range from lack of table manners to social etiquette.  I beg our parents and those responsible for fellow children to show us the way.  I leave you with the Grace of God

I remain
 - **Asobola Nissi**
 - **PRESIDENT**
